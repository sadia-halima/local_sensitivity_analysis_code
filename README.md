Code for Sensitivity Analysis of a mathematical model of AD in the submitted manuscript
This repository contains the code for sensitivity analysis of a mathematical model of Alzheimer's disease progression. The model incorporates the dynamics of amyloid-beta aggregation, tau protein phosphorylation, neuron degeneration, and immune response, including microglia and macrophages.

The purpose of this sensitivity analysis is to identify the most influential parameters driving changes in key disease biomarkers such as:
- Amyloid-beta (AŒ≤)
- Tau protein (œÑ)
- Living neurons (N)
